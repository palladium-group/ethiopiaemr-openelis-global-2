# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `feat/{issue-id}-{name}` **Input**: Design documents from
`/specs/[###-feature-name]/` **Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md
(required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY for all user stories (per Constitution V and
Testing Roadmap). Test tasks MUST appear BEFORE implementation tasks to enforce
TDD workflow.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by **Milestone** (per Constitution Principle
IX). Each Milestone = 1 PR. Milestones marked `[P]` can be developed in
parallel.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [M#] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[M#]**: Which milestone this task belongs to (e.g., M1, M2, M3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Milestone Dependency Graph

**Legend**: Arrows show dependencies. Parallel milestones have no arrows between
them.

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - Milestones from plan.md (Milestone Plan section)
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by MILESTONE so each milestone can be:
  - Implemented as a single PR
  - Developed in parallel (if marked [P]) or sequentially
  - Verified independently before merge

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.

cd frontend && npm run format
# Run E2E tests individually (per Constitution V.5):
npm run cy:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/[feature].cy.js"
# Full suite only in CI/CD: npm run cy:run

# Coverage reports
mvn verify  # JaCoCo report in target/site/jacoco/
cd frontend && npm test -- --coverage  # Jest coverage
```

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Milestone Dependencies

- **Milestone 1 (M1)**: Backend Core - No dependencies, starts immediately
- **[P] Milestone 2 (M2)**: Frontend - Can run in parallel with M1
- **Milestone 3 (M3)**: Integration - Depends on M1 AND M2 completion
- **Final Milestone**: Polish - Depends on all prior milestones

### PR Flow

```
develop
  ├── spec/{issue}-{name} (Spec PR #1)
  │
  └── feat/{issue}-{name} (Feature Integration Branch - optional)
        ├── feat/{issue}-{name}/m1-backend (Milestone PR #2)
        ├── feat/{issue}-{name}/m2-frontend (Milestone PR #3) [P - parallel]
        ├── feat/{issue}-{name}/m3-integration (Milestone PR #4)
        └── feat/{issue}-{name}/m{N}-polish (Milestone PR #5)
```

### Within Each Milestone

- Branch setup task MUST be first
- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Implementation tasks follow dependency order
- PR creation task is last
- All tests must pass before creating milestone PR

### Parallel Opportunities

**At Milestone Level**:

- Milestones marked `[P]` can be developed simultaneously
- Different developers can work on parallel milestones
- Sequential milestones must wait for dependencies

**At Task Level**:

- Tasks marked `[P]` within a milestone can run in parallel
- Entity/model tasks often parallelize well
- Test tasks often parallelize well

---

## Parallel Milestone Example

```bash
# Developer A works on M1 (Backend):
git checkout -b feat/OG-009-sidenav/m1-backend
# ... complete M1 tasks ...
# Create PR: m1-backend → feat/OG-009-sidenav

# Developer B works on M2 (Frontend) IN PARALLEL:
git checkout -b feat/OG-009-sidenav/m2-frontend
# ... complete M2 tasks ...
# Create PR: m2-frontend → feat/OG-009-sidenav

# After M1 and M2 PRs merged, Developer A or B works on M3:
git checkout feat/OG-009-sidenav
git pull  # Get merged M1 + M2
git checkout -b feat/OG-009-sidenav/m3-integration
# ... complete M3 tasks ...
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Milestone 1 Only)

1. Complete Milestone 1: Backend Core
2. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Create M1 PR, get review
3. Merge M1 - backend is now usable/testable
4. Continue with subsequent milestones

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Create Spec PR → Get alignment on approach
2. M1 PR → Backend reviewed and merged
3. M2 PR → Frontend reviewed and merged (can be parallel with M1)
4. M3 PR → Integration complete, E2E tests passing
5. Final PR → Polish and compliance verified
6. Each milestone adds value, each PR is reviewable

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. All developers review Spec PR together
2. Once Spec approved:
   - Developer A: Milestone 1 (Backend)
   - Developer B: Milestone 2 (Frontend) - IN PARALLEL
3. After M1 + M2 merged:
   - Any developer: Milestone 3 (Integration)
4. Faster delivery, smaller PRs, better reviews

---

## Notes

- `[P]` on milestones = can be developed in parallel with other `[P]` milestones
- `[P]` on tasks = can run in parallel within the same milestone
- `[M#]` label maps task to specific milestone for traceability
- Each milestone should be independently completable and reviewable
- Branch setup task is MANDATORY as first task of each milestone
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Create PR after all milestone tasks complete
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-milestone dependencies that
  aren't declared
